title: Data scientists and statisticians
---

In my understanding, a data scientist can give perdition by existing data, to result a scientific conclusion, such as a vaccine work or not, or provide guidance to our society lives, such as commercial decisions. 

A data scientist’s major duties include data ingest, cleaning, transformation, find a proper way to do the analysis based on his statistic knowledge, then using programming skills, such as R and SAS, to do the analysis. In the end, a data scientist often needs to adopt statistic concepts, such as confidence interval and p-value, to give a conclusion. 

Following aspects were compared between a data scientist and a tradition statistician:
Statisticians mostly do theoretical research, a data scientist’s job is to use existing theories to solve problems in reality.
Statisticians need very strong math knowledge, but maybe not need to know too much programming skills. A data scientist’s statistic knowledge is not as deep as a statistician’s, and he needs more programming ability.
Statisticians work with small scales of clean data, while data scientists often need to handle massive data, which sometimes need the data scientists to do cleaning, formatting, inputting, etc.
A data scientist often need to know some extra background on the area he study with, may includes biology, medication, economy, etc., to help him to find a proper way to do the analysis, and to find a correct conclusion.

I think these two areas are relative different parts of one whole object, statistic is like a tree, data scientist is the fruit borne on the tree. Without the support from tree, there won’t be a fruit. With the outcome of fruit, society may more willing to invest on the tree.
