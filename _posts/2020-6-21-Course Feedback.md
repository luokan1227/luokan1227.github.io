# How is the course going so far?  

Till now I can still handle this course. It takes me more time than expected  on this course, especially on homeworks. Most of homeworks were expected to be done within 1 to 3 hours, but I usually took almost a day.  
R is very flexible, it is a advantage, but also lead to the drawbacks that any minor difference on computer / system / setting may cause error, it is very frustrated when I fall into that kinds of issues.  

# What do you like about the course and what would you change about the course?  

I'm really excited about learning R markdown from this course. It is a powerful tool to create documents from all aspects. I will start using it in my work document prepration.  
I think the course should cover more on creating slides by R markdow, especially if there is anything more powerful than Powerpoints.  

# Any other thoughts?  (I just like to hear how everyone is doing and get feedback to incorporate!  

Is it possible to create a standardized R-studio environment on VTL? So students don't need to worry about their computer settings or R version which may cause a unexpected and not code related error.
