title: R compare to SAS
---

I learned SAS earlier, so I will give some of my own opinions on comparing R and SAS.  

To me, both R and SAS are very powerful data analysis tools. R is more flexible in coding, it’s much easier in doing calculations, such as calculate mean, variance, and it’s very each to store and use those results in other places. When doing SAS, it needs more fixed syntax to calculate, and will need more typing to store it for other uses.  

Another advantage of R is, it has a bigger community, its packages keep increasing and updating to achieve stronger and stronger power. Every new learner can easily search, obtain and use those packages. At my basic level of learning and using SAS, I feel SAS is more like a matured products, we learn and use the functions which it had already build in. I think it has both advantage and disadvantage sides. The good aspect is, it means people can learn SAS easier, and use SAS in more standardized ways, it will easier for other programmer to understand your code, and easier for QC. The bad side is, it may limit the ways you can analysis and present your data.  

There is one major advantage of SAS compare to R, in my thought, is SAS’s power in inputting data. When the raw data is not cleaned, SAS has strong ability to do correction. I spend a lot of time in learning how to input data and check if they are correctly inputted. At my current level of R, seems R will assume the data it reads is already cleaned.   

I feel it’s hard to tell is R a difficult language or not. For new learners and easy missions, R is easy, because It’s syntax is easy, codes combination is flexible, logic is plain. But for some statistic inference projects, R is hard for me, especially in writing some functions. I feel it’s more depending on experience, R is not hard to know, but hard to know all.
