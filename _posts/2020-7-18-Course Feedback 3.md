# what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do.  
I used to think data scientist's major job was just manipulate and analysis data. Now I think the work is much more complex and wide.  
Data scientists need firstly understand data, know what does each variable represent before they can start analysis, that's needs a lot of knowledge outside stastistic. Next 
they need communication with people such as clients and decision maker, to figure out what kind of output/report/app is satisfied. This will be a tough step, because in course, 
this part is majority done by teacher, but in real life, we will need a overall view on what request/function/look can be achived and whats are not.  

# what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?  
I think R is very useful for data sceience, I will continue use R. Because it's easy to install on any computer and free, tons of useful packages and easy to find sample code. 
I also like R's Rmarkdown function,  it can generate beautiful data interactive reports.  

# what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?  
I will use Rmarkdown to organize my lab SOPs, especially the layout worksheets. Shiny is cool, I can use it to present my data.
